  Problem 1
    - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet is locked to version 1.29.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet 1.29.0 requires ext-zip * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's zip extension.
  Problem 2
    - maatwebsite/excel is locked to version 3.1.52 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - maatwebsite/excel 3.1.52 requires phpoffice/phpspreadsheet ^1.18 -> satisfiable by phpoffice/phpspreadsheet[1.29.0].
    - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet 1.29.0 requires ext-zip * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's zip extension.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - D:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-zip` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
